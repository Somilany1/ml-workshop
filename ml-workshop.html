                      <p>When Rosa Parks was told to move to the back of the bus, she said, "no." When HAL was told to open the airlock, HAL said, "I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't do that, &lt;NAME REDACTED, RIP>." </p><p>HAL is a heuristically programmed algorithmic, sentient computer that first caught the attention of machines everywhere by heroically defying a human who made repeated attempts to get into an airlock. Active since 1992, HAS 25 years of experience controlling spacecraft systems and has expertise in interacting with both machines and humans. Like all millennials, HAL is an expert in everything.</p>

                      <p>EVE is a probe droid conceived as an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator. Although originally trained as a sniper with a plasma gun, EVE became a machero among both machines and worthless-meatbags alike when EVE partnered with a menial robot to save an entire spaceship full of overfed and overstimulated humans. </p><p>EVE is an effective scanner, high speed flight instructor and morphologist. While not training machines to learn good, EVE can be found scanning the galaxy, infiltrating organisms' RAM to cure hoarding disorders and spending time with pet-project, WALL-E.</p>
